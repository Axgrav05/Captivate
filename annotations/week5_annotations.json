    "annotation": "This meme humorously critiques the inconsistency of certain religious practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the decision to gather in crowded churches despite the risk of spreading the virus.\nThe text on the meme reads, \"If you truly believe I can hear your thoughts and prayer wherever you are\u2026 Then it doesn't make a lot of sense to crowd together in a church during a pandemic, does it?\" This implies that if someone believes in God, there should be no need for in-person church services to pray or communicate with God. The meme questions the logic of gathering in a potentially dangerous setting, like a church during a pandemic, when, according to religious belief, God is always present and can hear prayers anywhere.\nThe visual information accompanying the text shows an image of Jesus Christ, who is worshiped by Christians and is believed to be omnipresent, able to be everywhere at once. The background knowledge supporting this message is that COVID-19 has killed millions of people globally, and social distancing is a key measure to slow the spread of the virus. Despite these measures, many churches continued to hold in-person services, leading to criticism of their disregard for health and safety guidelines.\nOverall, the meme humorously critiques the contradictory nature of some religious actions during the pandemic, pointing out the inconsistency of gathering in crowded spaces for prayer when, according to their beliefs, God can hear their prayers from anywhere."

    "annotation": "The meme jokes about how vaccines allow children to live long, healthy lives.\n\nThe left side of the meme shows a baby labeled \"This is your child,\" while the right side shows an elderly man labeled \"This is your child on vaccines.\" The exaggerated contrast humorously implies that vaccines do not harm children but instead help them survive into old age. This is a response to anti-vaccine fears, using irony to highlight that vaccines contribute to longevity rather than causing harm. The rhetorical question \"Any questions?\" reinforces the idea that the benefit of vaccines is obvious.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that vaccines help children live long, healthy lives rather than harming them."

The meme's text contrasts this by saying, \"If you think your body has energy fields... it means you don't actually understand what energy is\", which refers to measurable physical properties like kinetic or thermal energy. The meme critiques the misuse of scientific terminology in spiritual or alternative medicine contexts.\n\nThe meme argues that spiritual \"energy fields\" are not scientifically valid concepts."

    "annotation": "This meme actually mock the lack of enthusiasm of certain Democratic voters toward Joe Biden as their 2020 presidential candidate, rhetorically asking how much enthusiasm and support he enjoys in the party.\nThe meme states the following, \"Do you know ANY Democrat who is enthusiastic and inspired that this is their nominee\u2026 and thinks this is the best and brightest they have to offer?\" What is being suggested here is that the author feels that Joe Biden's nomination was greeted with little excitement or inspiration by Democratic voters. The \"best and brightest\" language is used here to suggest that the speaker does not think Biden to be the best or most capable candidate of the Democratic Party.\nThe photo depicts Joe Biden with an expression of shock, the opposite of the criticism in the text, probably a look of astonishment at being chosen as the nominee. The background is that Joe Biden actually was the Democratic party's presidential nominee in 2020, but the meme is suggesting discontent or disillusionment regarding his candidacy.\nOverall, the meme is comically expressing the disappointment or anger that some Democrats would have had with Biden's candidacy in that it's implying that his nomination didn't come with fanfare or even that he was considered the best candidate of the party."

    "annotation": "This meme satirically mocks the reasoning for not eating plant-based meat but instead promoting conventional farming methods.\nThe caption to this meme says, \"The reason I don't eat plant-based meats is because I want to support our farmers. Sure, but aren't you ignoring the struggles of hard working individuals in the soybean mines?\" The use of this analogy highlights the irony of the argument. The initial half of the statement postulates that not eating plant-based meats is being undertaken to support farmers, normally those who deal in livestock for meat purposes. The second half of the meme then wryly notes that plant-based meat substitutes also support farmers, specifically those who produce soybeans, which are used to produce plant-based proteins. By using the \"soybean mines\" (an imaginary, hyperbolic notion), the meme is referencing the notion that those farmers are also laboring to create something which ultimately finds its way into the alternative meat market, thereby pointing to the possible unexpected byproduct of only supporting the meat industry.\nThe picture is of a man and woman talking and having a drink at a restaurant, an informal setting for this conversation about food choice. This setting gives the conversation the sense of everyday people sitting around talking about it, duplicating the way everyday people converse about eating habits and the ethical issues of whether to buy from one farm sector versus the other.\nIn general, the meme humorously satirizes the multi-step decisions of what types of agriculture to participate in, mocking the notion that one type of agriculture is simply more ethical than another but really implying that those who avoid plant-based meat in order to support farmers are ignoring the farmers who produce crops such as soybeans."

    "annotation": "This meme ironically pokes fun at the dissemination of conspiracy theories regarding 5G technology and refers to how ridiculous it is.\nThe meme states, \"The radiation from this lamp is several orders more energetic than 5G signals. Neither are deadly to your health. Except if you use them to read woo on the net.\" The latter part of the message is stating that you can clearly with your naked eye see that lots of things that you use in the house, i.e., lamps, are emitting more energetic radiation than 5G signals and nobody should generally be in fear of these day-to-day sources. It humorously insinuates that 5G waves, harmful as some conspiracy theories declare them to be, are benign. The latter portion of the passage includes a sardonic jibe, with an insinuation that it is actually the misinformation, or \"woo,\" that is found online and not the radiation itself, which inflicts actual damage. This is how most conspiracy theories survive on the internet, distorting facts and spreading unnecessary panic over harmless events such as 5G technology.\nThe image depicts a woman sleeping alongside a lamp, which juxtaposes the overblown fear of 5G radiation with the widespread use of electrical appliances that emit radiation with no negative effects. The image is used to highlight the irony of fearing radiation from 5G but utilizing common household appliances without fear.\nGenerally speaking, the meme satirically mocks the unwarranted hysteria surrounding 5G technology by using an example of a common household appliance to show how people are apt to ignore actual risks and focus instead on unfounded conspiracy theories."

The text on the meme says, \"50,000 people die from influenza and most people don't get vaccinated. A few cases of ebola, SARS, or corona virus show up and everone loses their minds.\" It points out that influenza kills thousands annually, yet many people ignore flu vaccines. Meanwhile, new diseases like Ebola, SARS, and COVID-19 cause widespread panic even with relatively few cases.\n\nThe meme suggests that familiarity breeds complacency, while new or unknown threats trigger a heightened emotional response."

    "annotation": "This meme compares two seemingly unrelated topics such as Halloween candy tampering and meteorite injuries to highlight the how succeptiple the public is to sensationalized threats.\n\nThe photo is of a shooting star in the distance in the night sky. Shooting stars are rare, and are considered special to witness; this alludes to the subject of the meme also pertaining to a rare event.\n\nThe first grouping of text says, 'Number of confirmed injuries due to strangers tampering with Halloween candy since 1970: None'. This information is meant to come as a surprise, as 'drugged' Halloween candy is a common fear with suburban parents. Highlighting that it has not happened once since 1970 showcases the fear as unrealistic and trivial.\n\nThe last grouping of text says 'Number of confirmed injuries due to meteorites since 1970: 1100+'. This relates to the subject of the image, of the shooting star/meteorite. This creates a stark contrast between a commonly known 'rare' event - the meteor fall - and a commonly known 'frequent' event - drugged Halloween candy. This highlights the Halloween candy drugging as even more of a rare event.\n\nThis meme employs irony to communicate that society tends to overreact to sensationalized, unlikely threats (such as candy tampering) while ignoring real dangers."

    "annotation": "This meme humorously mocks GMO skeptics through an exaggerated comparison to skeletons.\n\nThe photo is of a skeleton looking down at a phone. The skeleton, often a symbol of death, emphasizes the wait for proof that is considered unnecessary by the scientific community; scientists would live a lifetime and 'become skeletons' before receiving proof.\n\nThe top text reads 'Still waiting...' The '...' emphasizes the word 'waiting'; it drags the phrase on with no conclusion, relating it to the wait for proof of GMO harm.\n\nThe bottom text reads 'For peer reviewed evidence of eating GMO foods harming human health.' This describes the crux of the issue of the meme, that skeptics are suspicious of GMO foods despite there being no evidence of their harm.\n\nThe meme mocks the idea that people are still \"waiting\" for evidence on eating GMO foods being harmful that doesn\u2019t exist and calls attention to the unrealistic standards some place on scientific evidence."

The caption says, \"Nathan Rothschild Part of a family who: -Never financed both sides of any war. -doesn't own any central banks -are accused by conspiracy theorists of having more money than actually exists\".

The joke lies in the fact that the room is empty, implying that no such scientists exist or that no credible research supports the claim. This aligns with the mainstream scientific consensus that GMO foods are safe to eat and do not pose significant health risks.\n\nThe meme mocks anti-GMO beliefs by suggesting they lack scientific backing."

    "annotation": "The meme implies that dismissing climate science by pointing out minor unrelated issues is a weak argument.\n\nThe meme presents a conversation where a man says, \"We know that the increase in atmospheric CO2 comes from fossil fuels by examining isotopes. We know that an increase in CO2 means that more heat is trapped in the atmosphere. Adding more CO2 to the system will result in an increase in temperature.\", and a woman responds with, \"But some people at the climate protest were littering!\". This highlights a logical fallacy (a red herring or whataboutism), where someone deflects from a serious issue by focusing on a much smaller, unrelated problem. The meme critiques this kind of argument, suggesting that it avoids engaging with the actual scientific facts.\n\nOverall, the meme argues that ignoring climate science by focusing on minor distractions is not a valid argument."

    "annotation": "This meme makes the argument that a lot of the quotes attributed to Morgan Freeman on the internet are false, referencing the larger issue of misinformation/misattribution on the internet. The text in the meme says \"Just a heads up, most quotes you see from me being passed around the internet aren\u2019t actually mine. \u2013 Morgan Freeman\" with a picture of Morgan Freeman smiling underneath. This quote is ironic as it falls into the same category of false quote attributions the meme warns about. By having the quote attributed to Freeman alongside an image of him, the meme makes fun of the idea of people frequently believing in quotes just because they are attached to a well-known figure.\n\nThis meme references the fact that Freeman is an iconic actor known for his deep, strong voice and wise on-scree roles, making him a common target for misattributed inspirational quotes. This meme then uses this fact to make fun of the tendency of internet users to share quotes without verifying whether the person said that or not. This has happened to many public figures, such as Abraham Lincoln and Albert Einstein, which was then used to give credibility to a statement.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that people should be skeptical of quotes they see on the internet, as many of them are not true/misattributed. This meme uses irony to make light of the issue, by using Freeman's supposed words to highlight the blind trust in authoritative figures that happens on the internet."

    "annotation": "This meme makes a challenge to the age old belief that acupuncture and the meridian system were ancient Chinese concepts, by making their attribution to French author George Soulie de Morant in 1939. The text says: \"Where did the 'ancient' concept of Qi and meridians that your acupuncture practitioner speaks of originate? From this French author in 1939. Nothing ancient or Chinese about it.\" This statement is placed alongside an image of George Souli\u00e9 de Morant, emphasizing the claim that he was the true originator of these concepts rather than them being rooted in Chinese history.\n\nThis meme is built on the skepticism towards acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine by challenging the legitimacy of its origins. The claim of Soulie de Morant (rather than Chinese practitioners) formulating the concepts of Qi and meridians in 1939 implies that acupuncture is not as \"ancient\" or \"Chinese\" as often marketed. This is aligned with broader criticisms of alternative medicine where tools such as acupuncture are questioned for their validity. Furthermore, the watermark at the bottom of the photo \"Facebook.com/skepticalmemesociety\" implies that this meme was made by people in an online forum focused on skepticism of commonly accepted historical facts. This meme suggests that many people accept acupuncture's origins without actually examining its history, making it seem like a case of cultural rebranding.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that acupuncture and concept of Qi are not truly ancient Chinese, but a modern idea. The tone is critical, seeking to undermine the credibility of acupuncture by portraying it as artificially constructed belief system."

Please, no.\" with an image of a baby with wide, nervous eyes. The asterisks around \"president\" suggest skepticism or sarcasm, as if the baby is questioning the idea of Biden holding the office. The worried face the baby is making conveys shock/fear at the idea of Biden becoming president.\n\nThis meme is built on conservative criticisms of Biden, specifically those that portray him as unfit for office because of age-related cognitive decline. The nervous reaction of the baby is based on the sentiment that Biden's leadership is to be feared and avoided .Many conservatives believe that Biden's presidency would be disastrous for America due to his politics, perceived cognitive decline, and/or association with the Democratic Party agenda. The meme uses exaggeration to mock his candidacy.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that the idea of Biden as president is alarming. The tone is mocking, using visual exaggeration and sarcasm (with the asterisks) to emphasize the idea that Biden should not be president."

The top panel shows a flooded suburban neighborhood, accompanied by the text \"If you criticize others for ignoring hard scientific data confirming anthropogenic global warming...\" This refers to the scientific consensus that human activity is a significant driver of climate change, which some people deny. Those that do not believe in climate change are heavily criticized for not accepting overwhelming evidence of its existence.\n\nThe bottom panel contrasts this with an image of corn, with the text, \"..but ignore hard scientific scientific data that shows GMO foods are safe and organic food has no nutritional advantage...\" This highlights another areas of scientific discord: genetically modified organisms (GMOs). One side of this discord argues that GMOs are safe for consumption and do not drastically differ in nutritional value from organic foods. The opposing side reject these claims.\n\nThe final caption at the bottom of the meme reads, \"You're doing science wrong!\". This statement critiques the hypocrisy of criticizing those who do not believe in climate change, but turn a blind eye to the genetic modification of foods. The imagery and text work together to convey a sarcastic but pointed critique of selective skepticism toward science."

The image of two women looking at a laptop is a suggestion to how people engage with online content, potentially believing misinformation due to a misleading website name.\n\nThis meme makes a reference to Badger's Law, which states that the websites with \"truth\" in their URLs often contain little to no truthful content. This aligns with the reality that misinformation and biased reporting are rampant online and many untrustworthy sites use such names to appear more legitimate. This meme criticizes the gullibility of people who take such sites without verifying the source and/or their claims.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that a website's name does not determine its reliability and people should be skeptical of sites that boast their supposed honesty. The tone is sarcastic, using irony to emphasize how online sources can manipulate trust without necessary being factual."
