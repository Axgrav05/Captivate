According to the caption, Biden is saying, \"Come on man, you know the thing. Just ask my wife Joe the dog faced pony.\"\n\nGiven the rather nonsensical meaning of this quote, and the setting at a public speech, the meme is highlighting how Biden is often caught on video saying rather unusual things. People often attribute this to his age.\n\nThere are two specific gaffes which the quote may be referencing. First, \"my wife Joe\" may be a reference to how Biden once said \"I'm Joe Biden's husband.\" Second, the phrase \"dog faced pony\" is a reference to how he once called a person at one of his events a \"lying dog-faced pony soldier.\"\n\nThus, the meme is making a humorous parody of these two situations to mock Biden.

On the rim of the hat, it reads \"Mexico\" in the red, green, and white colors of the Mexican flag.\n\nThe caption at the bottom of the meme then makes a joke: \"When Kamala Harris got started in politics, she burned her Nissan the carpet.\" Here, \"Nissan\" is a humorous pun for the phrase \"knees on.\" In other words, Harris received carpet burn by placing her knees on a carpet. There is a lewd connotation behind kneeling on a carpet; specifically, the meme is implying that Harris would get on her knees to provide oral sex. Regarding her \"start in politics,\" the meme must be implying that Harris performed sexual favors for powerful politicians, who in turn gave her high-ranking political positions. It then stands to reason that Harris lacks any real political ability.\n\nThe use of Mexican culture here intends to make light of this allegation. While \"Nissan\" is not a Spanish word, the portrayal of the meme as a lesson in Mexican culture further compounds humor on top of the initial pun. Further, the sombrero's disproportionately large size compared to Harris' head adds another ridiculous element to the meme.\n\nThis humor intends to mock Harris for her lack of political ability, substituted with sexual favors.

It features a white flag of surrender, captioned below: \"this will be the only flag we can fly.\" The only option according to the meme is surrender, presumably a surrender of thought.

This refers to other occurrences of Biden being seen leaning in close to women as though he were sniffing them.\n\nAccording to the caption, Biden is saying \"She ain't black.\" This refers to two things.

Second, Harris' Indian and African-American heritage is disputed by some who think she is lying about her race to curry favor among voters.\n\nThus, this meme is making a humorous joke about the two politicians. It seems that Biden was able to check Harris' race by sniffing her, after which he quoted his controversial political ad. Behind this joke are three mocking accusations: (1) Biden sniffs people, (2) Biden's political advertisement was a gaffe, and (3) Harris is lying about being black.

Presumably, Hillary is participating in the Wheel of Fortune, and is trying to guess the correct phrase hidden on the letter board.\n\nStarting with the top panel, the caption at the bottom gives a hint as to the secret phrase: it asks for Hillary's \"thoughts on Bill Clinton.\" Most of the blanks on the board have already been filled out. Now, the phrase reads, \"My husban_ is a _e_o.\" Hillary is depicted smiling, as though she is excited to guess the phrase. According to the caption, she guesses that the phrase is, \"My husband is a hero.\" The meme's implication is that Hillary would want to praise her husband.\n\nHowever, this has skewed her thinking away from the correct answer, as given by the meme. The second, lower panel chronologically succeeds the first. Hillary now shows a disgruntled frown and the hidden phrase on the board has been filled out, now reading, \"My husband is a pedo.\" The implication is that Hillary has guessed incorrectly, and so the correct answer has been shown. Hillary's praise of her husband starkly contrasts with the insulting nature of the phrase, and therein lies the meme's joke. The abrupt contrast is further highlighted in the transition of Hillary's mood from excited to disappointed, which adds to the humorous nature of the tone and also mocks Hillary for her incorrect guess.\n\nThe phrase \"My husband is a pedo,\" however, is an inherent accusation of Bill Clinton as well.

DeGeneres is disliked for her personality, which was uncovered to be more unpleasant than she let on. Bill Gates is a proponent of vaccination and has heavy involvement with COVID-19; some people believe he is using COVID to profit, manipulate, or harm people.

Since Obama is giving these medals to them, or rather, he is honoring these people, he himself must be evil.\n\nGiven that Obama is being attacked, this meme's author must be right-leaning. They may subscribe to the QAnon conspiracy, in which public figures are believed to engage in human trafficking and oppose former Republican president Donald Trump.

Communism is a radical politically left ideology, so the meme is trying to accuse Trudeau of being a communist. Moreover, the meme is suggesting that Castro was a father figure who imparted communism and its historically horrific consequences to him.

    "annotation": "The meme is mocking former Democrat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nIt features a photo of Clinton exciting a car, with a distressed expression. In the reflection of the car window, Clinton's face is boxed with a red rectangle. According to the\ncaptions at the top, she is exclaiming, \"Rep Jerry Nadler in car accident!\" The implication is that Clinton got into a card accident with Jerry Nadler, as indicated by Clinton's distress in the image.\n\nHowever, she tries to claim innocence from the accident, as she shouts in the fully capitalized bottom caption letters, \"It wasn't me!\" However, her immediate and exclamatory dismissal of liability conversely implies that she caused the car accident on purpose, presumably to kill U.S. House Representative Jerrold (\"Jerry\") Nadler. This behavior refers to a conspiracy that Hillary Clinton secretly murders political opponents, or people who could compromise her corruption.\n\nNadler's relevance to the conspiracy on Clinton refers to the 2016 presidential election, when Clinton's controversial emails were leaked. Nadler made fun of former president Donald Trump for overreacting to the scandal, so people suspected that Nadler had some connection/insider knowledge about the emails. Since he may have the ability to compromise her, Clinton is depicted murdering Nadler to silence him. Since Nadler is not actually dead, this is a parody that means to comment in general about Clinton's murder conspiracy. This meme simply portrays how Clinton might hypothetically go about silencing Nadler.\n\nThe overall message can be deduced from Clinton's suspicious claim to innocence, which is easily dismissed. Since the image clearly displays Clinton exiting the car, clearly highlighting her guilt, her denial of guilt seems like a foolish attempt to hide her murderous intentions. This is to make fun of Clinton, portraying as someone too stupid to realize that she has been caught in the act of murder.\n\nThe joking nature creates a humorous, mocking overtone for the dark accusation: Hillary Clinton murders people who could politically compromise her."

    "annotation": "The meme criticizes violent protests while also making fun of ABC News' wording.\n\nThe meme features a screenshot of a X (formerly known as Twitter) post from ABC News, evident from the blue checkmark next to the user profile \"ABC News\" which is iconic of the website. The post reports, \"Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified.\" The meme uses this post to comment on how protests, particularly during the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020, sometimes escalated into violence.\n\nThe meme jokes about the wording of ABC's post. Below the post is a picture of former Russian dictator Joseph Stalin, edited with intense, glowing red eyes and framed with a background featuring a large crowd some Russian words. The meme is captioned at the bottom, \"Peacefulness intensifies!\" The meme is highlighting the humor of the original post in feature the two words \"peaceful\" and \"intensified,\" as these words seem to contradict in nature, especially regarding protests.\n\nStalin's shining red eyes portray the \"intensification of peacefulness,\" which has escalated into arson, destruction, and assault, according to the post. The meme calls this violence to attention through the particular use of Stalin and the Russian text, referencing his cruel and violent rule over the communist Soviet Union. By hyperbolically comparing the protest with Stalin and editing unusual red light into the image, the meme creates an absurd humor to make light of the situation and the contradictory nature of ABC's post.\n\nTherefore, the caption \"Peacefulness intensifies!\" is sarcastic, emphasizing that peacefulness cannot intensify. This leads to the meme's critical overall opinion, that the California protests are not peaceful, but rather violent."

    "annotation": "The meme criticizes Democrats' management of Portland.\n\nIt features a picture of the Thompson Elk Fountain of Portland, vandalized and set on fire. This violent image is juxtaposed with the enthusiastic caption at the top of the meme: \"Come visit Portland!\"\n\nThe meme's comment on Portland, coupled with the vandalism and arson, refers to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, some of which escalated into violence. The caption, then, is sarcastic, instead calling out Portland and the protests for the violent behavior as depicted.\n\nThe lower captions ascribe the blame of the state of Portland, claiming that is is \"Brought to you by: governor Kate Brown, Mayor Ted Wheeler, Portland Chamber of Commerce, Portland city commissioners, ANTIFA & Black Lives Marxists.\" Of particular note, the governor and mayor are Democrats, and the mention of the other Portland officials highlights the city's historical management by Democrat politicians. The additional mention of ANTIFA, known for its left-leaning nature and violent tendencies, further emphasize the violence of the protests in Portland. Meanwhile, Black Lives Marxists features the same acronym, BLM as Black Lives Matter and is intended to bash them for their behavior, associating BLM with the violence of communism observed in history.\n\nThe general idea of the list of names and entities is to associate the state of Portland with its managers: the Democrats. Thus, the sarcastic nature of the introductory caption is overshadowed by the outrageous connotations that condemn the Democrat party for its behavior, resulting in a scathing message: the Democrats destroyed Portland through their protests."

    "annotation": "The meme is mocking the government's behavior surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt is a two-panel comic of Drake in an orange jacket, a common meme format. In the top panel, Drake appears disgusted, turning away and blocking his sight from the caption to the right, which reads \"Arresting people for burning down buildings.\" The burning of buildings refers to the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain BLM protests escalated into violence, sometimes resulting in protestors burning buildings. Drake's dislike of arresting these people is meant to depict the behavior of the government. Though these protestors are destroying property, the government took no action against them. In other words, the government is allowing people to burn buildings.\n\nThe lower panel again depicts Drake, this time smiling with satisfaction while pointing towards the caption to the right, which reads, \"Arresting people for not wearing a mask.\" The masks refer to the requirement to wear masks in certain public places during COVID to reduce the spread of the virus. Drake's approval of arresting people who would not wear masks represents the government's enforcement of COVID restrictions, arresting those who do not wear masks when required.\n\nBy comparing the government's behaviors in these panels, a major difference in treatment can be seen between the two people. The meme expresses its disapproval of the government through the sheer absurdity in condoning the burning of buildings, but condemning the refusal to wear masks. Thus, Drake's expressions are sarcastic, aimed to portray the government's policies as ridiculous. This overall creates the humorous message that the government's COVID policies are absurd and condone immoral behavior."

    "annotation": "The meme is mocking people who are anti-Trump, presumably political leftists.\n\nIt features a picture of a news anchor, with a blue wallpaper behind him, patterned with the words, \"Channel 4 News.\" This depicts the meme as a news report. Leaning into this portrayal, the captions provide the anchor's headline, which begins, \"Breaking: the same people who said Trump would destroy America...\", before trailing off. The term \"breaking\" is used here as typical vocabulary of news reports that express urgency and novelty of the news topic.\n\nThis urgency surrounding the \"people who said Trump would destroy America,\" or people who are anti-Trump, is then delivered in the second caption: they \"are destroying America.\" This corresponds to the picture within the main image, which the news anchor is presumably reporting on. It features people cheering in front of a fire. Presumably, this depicts a left-leaning 2020 Black Lives Matter protest, which has escalated into violence and destruction. Since anti-Trump people are generally left-leaning, these people are meant to equate leftists and opposition to Trump.\n\nThe meme expresses a hypocrisy in that these people who claimed \"Trump would destroy America\" are now themselves burning, or rather, \"destroying America.\" The repetition of the phrase \"destroy America,\" separated by the trailing pause which is followed by a punchline, creates a sardonic humor that overlays an expressed disappointment in anti-Trump leftist behavior.\n\nThus, the meme's message is an attack on anti-Trump leftists, accusing them of hypocrisy and condemning their violent protests."

The image below then depicts AOC's response to receiving this insult.\n\nThe image is taken from Star Wars. It focuses on an ominously hooded Emperor Palpatine. He is pale, wrinkled, and generally ugly. According to the caption at the bottom, he says, \"The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.\" The intent is to portray AOC using Palpatine, and so \"getting called a bitch\" has left AOC \"scarred and deformed.\" This is a major overreaction to a verbal rebuke, and as such, paints AOC as easily offended and of poor mental fortitude. The absurdity of the portrayed behavior creates a humorous tone, mocking AOC.\n\nFurther, comparing Palpatine to AOC ascribes some of the fictional emperor's traits to her. He is the evil primary antagonist of the story, and as such, depicts AOC as some overly evil villain, again emphasizing the humorous nature of the meme through exaggeration. His ugly appearance also insults AOC's appearance as well.\n\nThus, this meme's message consists of two main points: (1) AOC is evil, and (2) she is easily offended."

    "annotation": "The meme is mockingly accusing liberals of hypocrisy.\n\nIt is a two-panel comic, focused on a man conversing with an angry-looking woman at a protest.\n\nThe top panel shows the woman with a surgical mask edited to cover her mouth, referencing the mask regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, scientifically supported by the Center for Disease Control to reduce the spread of coronavirus. In accordance with this, the woman is presumably exclaiming the captions to the image: \"You need trust science asshole!\" This aggressive statement directed towards the man is because he is not wearing a mask, and therefore not trusting the scientific justification behind wearing masks.\n\nPresumably, the woman is a liberal, because of her support of wearing masks and participation in a protests, both of which traditionally comprise liberal behavior.\n\nThe lower panel shows the man's response to the woman. He replies with a question: \"Ok. How many genders are there?\" The man is highlighting that the gender spectrum supported by liberal ideology has no scientific basis, as biologically, there are only the two sexes, male and female. In other words, the angry woman, and liberals in general, do not \"trust science\" because they believe in the gender spectrum. The man's retort has also angered the woman further, with her mask coming off to reveal a furious mouth expression, and her eyes now red and smoking with fury. This exaggerated anger is meant to make fun of the woman, and the liberals in general that she represents, portraying them as quick to anger.\n\nFurthermore, the comic points out a hypocrisy in liberal logic. They vehemently support the science for wearing masks, but they ignore the science when supporting the gender spectrum. This, combining with the exaggerated portrayal of the woman, leads to the humorous overall message: liberals are easily-offended hypocrites."

    "annotation": "The meme is criticizing gun regulation for endangering women.\n\nThe meme features a picture of a woman aiming a handgun. Her face expresses a seriousness and defensiveness that evokes sincerity in the meme. The caption provides commentary on this image. It first reads, in green, \"An intruder wouldn't try to disarm this woman,\" followed in black by, \"your elected representatives promised to do it for him.\"\n\nThe coloring of the words separates them into two separate thoughts, where the second section in black explains the strange claim of the first. It is unusual that an intruder would not try to disarm a woman; presumably, they would want to in order to avoid being shot. The second section explains this by claiming that the \"elected representatives\" of the government would do it for him. In other words, the government has promised to disarm the woman; in particular the meme is alluding to gun control.\n\nThe implication is that the government's implementation of gun control would disarm this woman, thereby making intrusion easier, since trespassers would not need to be afraid of a gun threatening them. Gun control is generally supported because people believe that removing deadly weapons would reduce violence and crime, though the meme argues that it would cause the opposite, increasing crime.\n\nThe sense of direct urgency in endangering the depicted woman's life transfers to the meme's final message and condemnation: gun control endangers people."
