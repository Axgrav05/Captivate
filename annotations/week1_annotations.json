The text overlaying the image reads, \"WHEN YOU SEE THE GUY WHO SAID 'YOU'LL NEVER BE PRESIDENT' AT YOUR INAUGURATION\". This text employs a humorous tone to depict a moment where Trump might feel triumphant over doubters, particularly Obama, who once expressed disbelief in Trump's ability to become president. The underlying message is a satirical take on overcoming skepticism and achieving unexpected success. The juxtaposition of the two figures highlights a contrast in expectations versus reality. The meme uses this imagery and context to provoke a humorous response by playing on themes of rivalry and political drama. Ultimately, the meme seeks to entertain while subtly commenting on political dynamics and personalities."

    "annotation": "The meme emphasizes the differences between Pat Tillman and Colin Kaepernick. It contains the text: \"There is no comparison between pat tillman and colin kaepernick\" and the image of Pat Tillman in army uniform. Collin Kaepernick was an NFL player who lost his job due to protesting the National Anthem. Pat Tillman was an NFL player who left his football career to join the military, and is considered a hero. Critics of Kaepernick believe that his protests were disrespectful to the military, and mock those comparing the two for their sacrifices. The meme emphaizes the difference in protesting by Pat Tillman and Colin Kaepernick. The meme degrades Colin Kaepernick as he was protesting the honor of the Nation, while Pat Tillman protested to join the military and fight for his nation, therefore these are different kinds of protests. The meme also take a positive tone toward Pat Tillman by portraying him as a war hero and his sacrifice was noble unlike Colin."

AOC was a former bartender who became an outspoken politician and many people question if her background makes her unfit to be a politician. Make America Great Again is a slogan used by Trump's presidential campaign. The meme creates a parallel between the popular Trump campaign slogan and the the text displayed on the meme. By doing so, the meme creates a satirical comment toward AOC and her background, indicating that she is unfit to be a politician, a view held by many republican Trump supporters, who are portrayed by the red cap which is common among Trump supporters."

    "annotation": "The meme is attacking Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.\n\nThe meme features a photo of its target, Jacob Frey. The caption begins, \"The mayor of Minneapolis wants 55 million dollars for damages caused by riots.\" This refers to Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests in Minneapolis that escalated into violent riots, resulting in excessive property damage.\n\nThe core message is in the exclamation that follows the first sentence: \"I don't think he should get a penny!\" The text expresses discontent because Frey did not call in law enforcement to stop the riots. This is likely because, as Democrat, Mayor Frey supports BLM. As such, the meme is implying that it is his fault that Minneapolis suffered damage, and so his hypocritical request for money should be denied. The exclamation mark at the end of the meme's claim emphasizes the vehement tone in the refusal of Frey's request.\n\nA final question concludes the caption: \"Do you agree?\" Though it is structured as a question, it encourages the audience to agree that Frey \"should not get a penny\" of his 55 million dollar request.\n\nGiven the disapproval of Mayor Frey, the final message is a criticism of his behavior: Jacob Frey is an inept and hypocritical mayor."

His expression conveys a serious and unhumorous tone.\n\nThe caption beneath Trump begins, \"President Trump says he will designate ANTIFA as a terrorist group.\" This refers to how, though ANTIFA is a left-wing anti-fascism and anti-racism group, many of their protests and actions escalate into violence and riots. Right-leaning Republicans like Trump often view ANTIFA as a radical far-left violent group. Given the sincerity of the tone, the meme must be agreeing with and praising Trump for labeling ANTIFA as a terrorist group.\n\nThe second sentence asks, \"Do you agree with him?\" Though this is a question, it actually encourages the audience to agree with meme's message, namely, that ANTIFA is a terrorist group and Trump is doing a good job antagonizing them."

Notably, though he is on the heavier side, Trump is not excessively overweight.\n\nThe caption begins, \"Nancy think this is morbidly obese,\" where \"this\" refers to Trump's body. Speaker Nancy Pelosi likely made this claim due to her opposition towards Trump and desire to deface him. However, since morbid obesity is commonly associated with visible rolls of fat and an inability to stand, Trump must not be morbidly obese. Thus, the meme discounts Pelosi's claim, and this negative stance gives off a serious tone to the meme's message.\n\nFinally, the meme extends a question to the audience: \"What do you think?\" This is actually intended to encourage the audience to also discount Pelosi, implying that Trump is most certainly not obese. This portrays Pelosi as ridiculous for thinking Trump is morbidly obese.\n\nGiven these portrayals, the overall message of the meme must be that Trump is not overweight and Pelosi is crazy for thinking he is."

The top caption asks, \"When did America stop being great?\" There is a notable assumption that America has become worse.\n\nThe meme then answers its question with its bottom caption: \"When this clown was elected twice!\" The \"clown\" refers to the photo of Barack Obama smiling. He is edited to be dressed in a colorful suit, and he has a frizzy red hairstyle, much like a clown. The depiction is meant to ridicule him, adding slight humor to the meme.\n\nThe words \"elected twice\" refer to Obama's two consecutive terms as president. The implication is that America has \"stopped being great\" since Obama's election. In other words, Obama's \"clown-like\" behavior has made America worse.\n\nThe structure of the sentences and the clown portrayal indicate a joke. The exclamation of the second sentence seems to be a punchline that mocks Obama. As such, the tone of the meme is overall set to be humorous with a backhanded aggression.

The idea, and overall message, is that, similar to how COVID was an uncurable virus that plagued the world, Pelosi is an \"uncurable virus\" that plagues America."

His supporters believe that the political systems in America are trying to obstruct Trump, as he poses a threat to their control over America.\n\nAccording to the caption, then, Trump was \"great\" but is now \"the greatest of all time\" because he is fighting the heavy opposition of a \"rigged system.\" The added context also indicates that the image intends to depict Trump as a hard worker who is always on flights around America. The genuine praise and reference to the heavy topic of a \"rigged system\" add a serious and unhumorous overall tone to the meme.\n\nSince there is no humor, the meme's praise of Trump is its message: Donald Trump is the greatest president in history."

Given the negative connotation of \"cokehead,\" the introduction using \"Hey everyone\" is intended to be demeaning towards Neil Terell. Accordingly, this introduces an aggressive tone.\n\nThe caption then continues, \"Perfect example of the washed up broke liberal.\" Here, the meme is using elements of the image typical of low-income individuals to label Terell as \"broke.\" Mainly, drug usage is stereotypical of low income individuals. However, additional elements include the cheap attire Terell is dressed in, as well as the cheap clothing of the woman in the background of the image. This negative imagery further compounds the aggression the meme exudes.\n\nLabelling Terell as a liberal highlights how liberals support the decriminalization of drugs. As such, it follows that a drug user would be a liberal. Using this association, the meme generalizes the insults about Terell to all liberals, setting him as an \"example of the washed up broke liberal.\" In other words, liberals are poor and addicted to drugs."

This quote from Clyburn paints Democrats as morally bankrupt because they are capitalizing on suffering to improve their party's standing.\n\nIt is implied that the Democrats are trying to appear morally upstanding, but this secret that Clyburn \"gave away\" revealed their true sinister nature.

He begins, \"Nike called and said they were being looted by Black Lives Matter.\" This references two things: (1) Nike endorses BLM and (2) BLM protests often escalate into looting. As such, this text highlights an ironic situation in which company that supports BLM was getting robbed and requesting the help of law enforcement. However, BLM is notoriously at odds with police enforcement, as they claim that police brutality primarily targets black people due to prejudice among the police force. Some also openly advocate to defund the police.\n\nAs such, the cop capitalized on the irony to joke, \"I told them to call the NFL for help!\" Again, the exclamation mark at the end of the sentence highlights the humorous tone. What the cop implies is that, since Nike supports BLM, they inherently support defunding the police. Thus, they do not deserve the help of police officers and are instead redirected to ask the NFL for help, as they are another company that endorses BLM.\n\nIt is clear then, that the irony and humor is intended to mock the NFL and Nike for getting robbed by the BLM movement they support.

The caption is a reference to how the Democratic party designates itself as the party of tolerance and diversity. Their platform revolves around supporting marginalized groups to provide an equal opportunity to all, irrespective of race or gender. As such, the opposing Republican party is portrayed as racist and sexist when they oppose these Democratic policies.\n\nThe \"VP\" (vice president) in question is featured in the image. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is shown standing next to President Joe Biden. An important note of the 2020 presidential election is that Biden vowed to pick a woman as his vice president. The meme's accusation is that choosing a black woman as a vice president was intended to appeal to voters who desired the representation of marginalized groups. However, in focusing their selection of their VP \"based on race and sex,\" specifically black women, the Democratic party has committed a hypocrisy, as they are preventing equal opportunity for any other race or sex.\n\nThis accusation gives off a negative and serious tone, accentuated by the lack of humorous elements.

Castro was the communist dictator of Cuba who ruled oppressively. His depiction and smile is meant to highlight the evil and oppression that these unchecked governments are capable of, and presumably, what will eventually occur.\n\nThe fear of this threat sets an overall serious tone, despite Castro's smile.

Accordingly, Bill Gates is feeling disappointed that he has wasted his money.

Party balloons and streamers fill the background. The lighthearted and smug aura from this image indicates the humor in the tone of the meme, and it also gives slight indication as to the meme's standpoint.\n\nThe bottom caption then concludes the proposition, \"they wouldn't need to censor us.\" The implication is that claims that are blatantly wrong do not need to be censored. Therefore, the \"we\" referred to in the text is not really wrong about \"them.\"\n\nThe use of the idea of \"censoring wrong\" people identifies \"we\" and \"them.\" Certain social media platforms, particularly, Twitter and Facebook, were accused of censoring voices on their sites. While their goal was to eliminate misinformation, conservatives believed it was a ploy to silence them and portray them as disseminators of misinformation. Given this context, \"we\" must be those conservative voices, and \"they\" must be Facebook and Twitter. However, \"they\" can be further extended to represent liberals, as it is believed the targeted censorship of conservatives originates from a liberal scheme to obstruct opposition.\n\nThus, the expression on the woman's face is used to affirm that conservative voice are being proven to be truthful because Facebook and Twitter are censoring them. The sense of smugness and humor stems from the irony in this meme. Facebook and Twitter's censorship policies are aimed to portray conservatives as misinformation spreaders; however, by aggressively censoring them, these media platforms are implicitly admitting that conservatives are right and their words are a threat to Facebook, Twitter, and liberals.\n\nThus, the message of the meme is twofold: it (1) celebrates conservative voices on the internet for being truthful and (2) makes fun of Twitter and Facebook for helping prove these conservative voices correct, even though they were trying to silence them."

Fauci advised people to stay indoors in a lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID.\n\nThe lower panel, however, doubts Fauci's claim.

This implies that Fauci is incorrect about the lockdown's effectiveness. He might even possibly be lying for some ulterior motive. Such an accusation lends a heavy mood and serious tone. However, Epstein's curt reply adds an grim but humorous aspect in doubting Fauci's platform.\n\nThe use of Epstein may highlight the meme's belief in this accusation against Fauci. Epstein died in prison, and there is a conspiracy that Epstein was murdered to silence him. Factoring this conspiracy in, the meme draws parallels from Epstein's death while locked up in prison to indicate that the COVID-19 lockdown, which similar confines people to small spaces, is endangering the public. Thus, Fauci's ulterior motive may be to harm people by locking them up.\n\nGiven this accusation of Fauci and reference to Epstein, the message of the meme is that the COVID-19 lockdown is not particularly safe and may even be dangerous."

Above, the caption reads \"On the same day President Trump expanded education and economic opportunities to Hispanics...\", pointing towards the photo Trump smiling and holding a document in his hand. He is being applauded, and presumably, this is Trump in the act of \"expanding education and economic opportunities to Hispanics.\" This is especially praiseworthy given the rough situations of many Hispanics in America, and the applause in the image encourages the audience to also praise Trump's virtue.\n\nThe lower panel compares the actions of the left and its representative Democrats. Its caption completes the trailing thought from the text above: \"The left launched a boycott against a Hispanic-owned family business for supporting Trump.\" The image clarifies which company the meme is referring to. It features photo of two men, one of the whom is Robert Unanue, the CEO of Goya Foods, standing in front a GOYA Foods building. This must be the \"Hispanic-owned family business,\" as Unanue publicly endorsed Trump.\n\nThus, the left is being negatively depicted for boycotting a Hispanic business. The implication is that they are discriminating against their race, which adds an unhumorous and negative tone to the meme. On the other hand, Trump is giving positive opportunities for Hispanics.\n\nThere is additional irony in the comparison, however. The Democrats generally represent the party of racial diversity and tolerance, especially towards marginalized and struggling populations like Hispanics in America. Meanwhile, the Republicans are generally depicted as disliking Hispanics, because they oppose illegal immigration and believe that Hispanics are illegally entering America.\n\nSince the Democrats are targeting and boycotting a Hispanic business, there is a highlighted hypocrisy in their actions. Meanwhile Trump's praiseworthy actions are intended to dispel the belief that Republicans dislike the Hispanic population.\n\nThe overall message, then, is twofold, though the negative focuses its message on the Democrats. First, Donald Trump is a good president who helps marginalized groups. Second (the meme's focus), Democrats are hypocrites who only appear tolerant when it benefits them."

They use a parallel structure, each beginning with \"He told us\" or \"He warned us,\" which serves to strengthen the message behind each point and further build a serious tone.\n\nFirst, \"He told us to protect our borders,\" referring to Trump's anti-immigration stance.\n\nSecond, \"He told us to bring manufacturing back home,\" referring to Trump's focus on returning outsourced manufacturing to American facilities.\n\nThird, \"He told us to be less dependent on other countries,\" which, like the previous point, references Trump's emphasis on an economically self-sufficient America.\n\nFourth, \"He warned us about China,\" referring to Trump's opposition of China, particularly as an economic superpower and competitor to America.\n\nThe final, fifth point instead attacks Democrats, solidifying the meme's positive stance on Trump and his policies. It reads \"Democrats fought him every step of the way!\", in reference to the staunch opposition Trump received during his presidency. The exclamation highlights the meme's dislike that Democrats are trying to stop Trump. The implication is that Trump's policies have improved America, but Democrats are stopping him, presumably because of some ulterior and corrupt motive.\n\nAs such, the overall message is: (1) Trump is a good president and (2) Democrats are corrupt."

    "annotation": "The meme is attacking Democrat Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe text is split into captions, to factor in the meme's image, for an intensified message. The top caption begins, \"As a taxpayer and citizen of this country, I do hereby demand.\" Notably, the use of the formal speech pattern \"do hereby demand\" sets a intense and serious tone.\n\nCutting off the text, the picture is of a dark swirling storm cloud. In its center, a single light bolt is striking the ground. The meme evokes lightning's powerful, bright flashes and the loud crackling of thunder to add an aggressive tone to meme, as though the meme's \"demand\" is so intense and powerful that lightning crackled forth the indicate its gravity.\n\nThe bottom caption clarifies the meme's \"demand,\" which is the overall message. It reads, \" the arrest and conviction of senator Chuck Schumer for his threats to the supreme court!\" The exclamation similarly amplifies the sincerity and aggression.\n\nThe \"threats\" which the text refers to are some negative remarks from Schumer towards two Supreme Court justices, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The meme is implying that this sort of behavior is not just unacceptable, but also criminal. As such, the meme advocates for the \"arrest and conviction\" of Chuck Schumer."

    "annotation": "The meme makes a pun. It contains the image of Nanci Pelosi smirking and Donald Trump grinning. The meme also contains the text: \"we weren't notified before the attack on soleimani neither was he.\" Nancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House of Representatives and a opponent of Trump.\nQassem Soleimani was considered an enemy of the United States. In 2020, an airstrike was launched to attack Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was killed in the attack. The meme creates a pun here by stating that Nanci Pelosi who represents the Democrats, weren't notified of the attack on Soleimani; however, Trump also indicates that Soleimani was also not notified. This creates a satirical comment by emphasizing the secrecy o the attack to improve it's probability of success."

    "annotation": "This meme provides an alternate viewpoint of the situation regarding Trump and Biden and their affiliates. The meme contains the text: \"let me get this straight Biden blackmailed Ukraine with a billion in tax dollars to drop an investigation into his son and democrats want to impeach president trump for simply asking if it was true? Visual information (can be wrong)\" and the image of a cat reading a book with glasses on. Trump was impeached in 2020 for asking Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.\nTrump was impeached twice and many people believe that he was only impeached because he was so disliked by other politicians\nIn 2019, Donald Trump urged Ukrainian officials investigate Biden. The meme highlights the fact that Trump was impeached for the same reason as Biden is currently acting while in office. Therefore the meme mocks the inconsistent enforcement of laws in the country."

    "annotation": "The meme is supporting former Republican U.S. president Donald Trump for attacking Democrat House Representative Ilhan Omar.\n\nThere are two photos, for each of the targets of the message. On the left is Donald Trump, and on the right is Ilhan Omar. Trump is talking, with an irritated expression, adding an aggression to the tone. Omar looks somewhat serious, and slightly saddened, giving a serious tone.\n\nThe text below poses the meme's message as a question. It asks, \"Do you agree with President Trump when he told Ilhan Omar she could get out of America and said, 'You can't leave fast enough.'\" The meme emphasizes and supports Trump's words by highlighting the words \"get out\" and \"You can't leave fast enough\" in yellow. Furthermore, \"get out\" is fully capitalized. Thus, the text must be demanding Omar to leave America, mainly to leave her office as Congresswoman.\n\nThe particular messaging about \"getting out\" may be in reference to Omar's actions and past. First, she is Muslim, as can also be noted by the hijab she is wearing in the image. Second, she was not born in America, but rather fled from Somalia to the U.S. Finally, third, some of Omar's comments on social media were considered anti-Semitic.\n\nThus, people have used her religion, foreign origin, and aggressive nature to label her as a stereotypical Middle Eastern terrorist. As such, the meme echoes these beliefs. It uses Trump as an authority figure to empower the message, and aggressively demands the exile of Omar both from her political office and America."

I enforced the law he passed for two terms\u201a Isn't it hilarious that democrats are demonizing me for enforcing their law!\" and the images of the previous 3 presidents before Trump, which includes Obama and Clinton.Clinton and Obama are democratic presidents who served before Trump.\nTrump has been blamed for separating children that cross the border illegally from their parents.\nClinton and Obama align with the Democratic Party.\nTrump aligns with the Republican party.\nDuring Clinton's presidency, he signed an overhaul of the immigration system that enforced immigration more strictly. Obama and Trump as successors continued that policy. Therefore, the meme mocks democrats by suggesting that the law scrutinized and enforced by Trump, who was blamed of separating families, was actually originally implemented and enforced by democrats."

This meme emphasizes here relatively minuscule portion of ancestry that traces back to the Native Americans and her unreasonable statement that she identifies as Native American although she is predominantly white and doesn't resemble being Native American. The meme creates a tone of a pun by comparing her ancestry to her chances of winning the presidential race by stating that both are 1/1024 which is extremely small."

    "annotation": "The meme is mocking opposition to former Republican president Donald Trump.\n\nThe text highlights a hypocrisy. It begins, \"Remember that the same people who told you Trump would start a nuclear war...\", trailing off to add a hint of tension to the tone of the text. It imperatively asks the audience to recall a certain kind of \"people,\" namely, Trump haters, who had feared that Trump would incite a nuclear war.\n\nThus, Trump haters must all-out warfare. The text uses this reasoning to attack Trump haters. Starting from where the text trailed off, it continues, \"are now the same people upset over peace.\" Trump haters are depicted as being \"upset over peace,\" presumably because Trump is responsible for said peace. The text emphasizes this contradictory logic by reminding the audience that the \"same people\" who opposed war out of fear for Trump are also the \"same people\" who are angered at peace caused by Trump. The word \"peace\" is also highlighted in yellow to emphasize how ridiculous and twisted it is to oppose peace. The implication is that Trump haters are so focused on opposing Trump that they would oppose the good things he does as well.\n\nThe meme takes on a mocking stance in its message, as evident from the picture of Trump smiling with his eyes shut, nearly laughing. The humor drawn from his face depicts the text as joke, that first introduces a topic, trails off, then delivers a punchline. Thus, factoring in this humorous tone, the meme's message is to ridicule Trump haters for being so illogical."
