    "annotation": "This meme makes fun of 2 conspiracy theories by combining the (debunked) claims that wind turbines cause cancers, and that chemtrails are a form of harmful aerial spraying. The text is a conversation between two people with one person saying, \"I'm really worried about getting cancer from those wind turbines!\" while the other responds, \"Well, they blow the chemtrails away, so I think it's worth the risk.\" The text is followed by the visual of two people walking on a beach with wind turbines in the background. The second speaker's response mocks both conspiracy theories by \"logically\" connecting both of them. By doing so, the implication is that the belief in one is as absurd as the belief in the other.\n\nThe first conspiracy theory in this meme is a reference to the concern that proximity to wind turbines can cause cancer. There has been no credible studies proving this claim, and as a result is misinformation. The second conspiracy theory in this meme is the chemtrail conspiracy theory, which claims that the trails left by aircraft are harmful chemicals being sprayed in the air for evil purposes. This theory has also been debunked as the contrails are condensation of water vapor in the air. The image provided reinforces the ironic nature of the dialogue. Wind turbines are associated with clean energy and environmental benefits, but this meme presents an exaggerated/illogical fear about them.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that the concerns behind wind turbines and chemtrails are rooted in irrational fears and conspiracy thinking. The tone is satirical as it makes fun of these theories by presenting them in a way that makes them seem crazy."

The text says \"I don't get it. My parents refuse to vaccinate me because they say the aluminum in vaccines is position. Then they go and feed me food that contains aluminum all day?\". The statement is placed on an image of a child (who says the above text as dialogue) eating a waffle, symbolizing consumption of ultra-processed foods (known to contain industrial chemicals/materials) by children.\n\nThis meme pokes fun of a supposed contradiction in the logic of anti-vaxxers (informal term for people against vaccines) who are afraid of aluminum exposure through vaccines, but do not apply the same fear to dietary sources. Aluminum is known to be present in many processed foods (such as baking powder) yet, according to this meme, parents who reject vaccines because of their supposed aluminum toxicity often overlook/ignore this. This meme implies that their fear is based on misinformation and not scientific concern.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that anti-vaccine beliefs are not consistent and grounded in science. By framing this argument through the perspective of a confused child, this meme uses irony to emphasize the contradictory logic of anti-vaxxers ."

The text states \"Nautropathy, for those who want to look like a real doctor, but can't be bothered with all that pesky science\", making the implication that people who believe in naturopathy present themselves as actual medical professionals, avoiding the actual scientific rigor needed of real doctors. The text is placed on an image of a smiling woman dressed up as a doctor, adding to the argument that naturopaths (people engaging in naturopathy) take the appearance of medical professionals without sticking to the same science-based standards.\n\nNaturopathy is a field that is based on natural remedies and alternative healing methods, but its efficacy is widely argued/disputed within the scientific/medical communities. Conventional medicine relies on peer-reviewed research and medical training, whereas naturopathy has been criticised for using treatment that lack empirical support. By describing science as \"pesky\", the meme portrays naturopaths as avoiding scientific rigor, further enforcing the idea that their practices are unscientific.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that naturopathy is not real medicine and that naturopaths are not real doctors as they do not stick to the same scientific principles as conventional medical doctors. This meme uses sarcasm and humor to portray naturopathy as an illegitimate alternative to regular medicine."

The text states: \"Most children undergoing cancer treatment cannot be vaccinated. Their lives are in danger from unvaccinated people. Vaccines. It isn't always about you.\" followed by an image of a sad-looking child with cancer, holding a doll. The text emphasizes that unvaccinated people pose a risk to those who have compromised immune systems (such as cancer patients) and unable to receive vaccines themselves. The image of the child reinforces the emotional weight of the argument as it depicts a young patient particularly susceptible to infections.\n\nVaccination is often widely promoted as a public health measure to protect both vaccinated individuals as well as establish herd immunity, which prevents those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions from getting ill. Anti-vaccine arguments often focus on personal freedom/risks of vaccination but the meme highlights the ethical responsibility of protecting those who are vulnerable, counteracting that viewpoint. The phrase \"It isn't always about you\" directly mentions those who refuse vaccines, framing their decision as selfish.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that refusing vaccines is not just a personal decision, but has broader consequences that could endanger the lives of individuals with compromises immune systems, particularly children with cancer. This meme uses an emotional/moral appeal to emphasize the importance of vaccinations."

The text shows a conversation between Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy, where DiCaprio states: \"Cancer cures are suppressed because there's more money to be made in treating than curing.\" Murphy then responds: \"You're trying to tell me tobacco companies wouldn't pay huge money for a cancer cure?\", with DiCaprio then staring intently at Murphy. Murphy's argument implies that if cancer cures existed, tobacco companies would have a motivation to fund/promote it as then their products are no longer considered fatal. The image of DiCaprio staring represents a moment of realization, emphasizing that the conspiracy theory doesn't make sense.\n\nThis meme brings up the longstanding conspiracy theory of cancer cures being purposefully hidden under the idea that the medical industry profits more from extended treatment than a single cure. This meme challenges this theory by pointing out the fact that industries associated with causing cancer (the tobacco industry) would benefit from a cure. Since smoking is a well known cause of lung cancer, if there was a cure, tobacco companies would continue selling their products without the consequences. Hence, this meme suggests that the idea of a suppressed cancer cure doesn't make sense because multiple industries would have a financial interest in developing a cure.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that the conspiracy theory about suppressed cancer cures don't make sense, as powerful industries which contributed to cancer (such as tobacco companies) would stand to gain from a cure. This meme employs irony to challenge the conspiracy, using a reaction meme format to illustrate the logical disconnect in the original argument."

There is an image of 2 pilots in the cockpit of an airplane, with text that states \"Spreading the chemtrails is actually quite easy,\" but that \"Getting them right to the edge of the Earth without flying off into space is the difficult part.\" This statement assumes that both conspiracy theories are true while bringing up contradictions between them. If the Earth were flat, pilots would struggle to avoid flying off the edge, which doesn't make sense given the principles of physics.\n\nThe chemtrail conspiracy theory claims that white condensation trails left by aircraft are harmful chemicals being sprayed into the atmosphere for evil reasons. On the other hand, the flat Earth conspiracy claims that the Earth is not a sphere but a flat plane, a belief going against centuries of scientific evidence. By combining both these two conspiracies in a single joke, the meme highlights the ridiculousness of both. It implies that those who believe in such theories fail to recognize their own logical inconsistencies (how would a global spread of chemtrails work on a flat earth where reaching \"the edge\" would be the major concern)\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that such conspiracy theories are illogical and contradict themselves. By presenting an exaggerated scenario where pilots struggle to manage chemtrails on a flat earth, the meme makes fun of the lack of scientific reasoning in these beliefs. The meme uses an absurd tone, emphasizing the idea that these theories should not be taken seriously."

The text states \"The Democrat ticket is Biden-Harris? Stop, you're gonna make me pee!\" with an image of a baby laughing hysterically. The image of the baby in this meme exaggerates the reaction, saying that even someone as innocent and uninformed as a baby would find the idea of Biden and Harris running for office crazy.\n\nThe humor in the meme is from the exaggerated reaction of uncontrollable laughter, implying that the Biden-Harris ticket should not be taken seriously. The phrase \"Stop, you're gonna make me pee!' is used casually when something is really funny, emphasizing the idea that Biden and Harris were very unqualified for leadership. This meme aligns with common conservative criticisms of Biden (his age and mental sharpness) as well as Harris (her policies).\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that the Biden-Harris ticket was a joke, not worthy of any serious consideration.

The text states, \"Breaking news! University of Google alumni left reeling as Dunning-Kruger Syndrome spreads unchecked through their ranks,\" with an image of people standing with candles (possibly in a vigil). The phrase \"University of Google alumni\" makes fun of individuals who believe browsing Google results gives them the equivalent of a formal university education, making the implication that they are self-proclaimed experts lacking real qualifications. The mention of Dunning-Kruger Syndrome is a reference to this critique, as it describes people who overestimate their knowledge due to a lack of actual expertise.\n\nThe image of the candle-light vigil adds another layer of humor by framing the situation as if it were a serious/tragic event. The meme makes the suggestion that people who engage in armchair research (surface level knowledge) and claim authority in complex subjects (medicine, science, or politics) are misinformed and spreading ignorance. This idea aligns with criticisms of internet \"experts\" in areas like health and conspiracies, who often reject established science in favor of their own biased research.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that people who rely on Google for expertise without formal education/thinking suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect, making them overconfident and uninformed.

It was just another case of bad science reporting by a credulous media.\" alongside a black and white image of 4 scientists in a lab. This directly addresses the people who may have believed the exaggerated reports, emphasizing that the media calls attention to scientific findings without proper scrutiny.\n\nThis meme is a reference to an event in 2019 where Israeli researchers claimed that they were on the verge of developing a cure for cancer within a year. This claim was reported by the media but was then debunked as too optimistic and not founded in science. \"credulous media\" makes the suggestion that news outlets are too eager to report sensationalized stories without fact checking, often misleading the public about advancements.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that people should be skeptical of such science reporting, as the media often exaggerates these discoveries. The tone is critical, calling out both the media for bad reporting and people for believing these claims."

Zilch.\" followed by an image of three farmers standing next to a large tractor. The repeated emphasis on \"nothing\" (\"None.Zip.Nada.Zilch\") reinforces the idea that no scientific link has been established. The image implies that the farmers, who have the highest exposure to glyphosate, are healthy and don't experience elevated cancer rates.\n\nGlyphosate has been at the center of debate regarding its health risks, as the International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) has labeled it \"possibly carcinogenic\". However, other large-scale studies. including those by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency have found no link between glyphosate exposure and increased cancer risks. This meme's central argument is dismissing the concerns over glyphosate's safety by saying that extensive research hasn't found evidence of harm.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that fears about glyphosate causing cancer are not supported by large scientific studies. The tone is dismissive, using strong language to reject any claims of a link to cancer."

Animals however do not respond to placebos, so all veterinary acupuncturists are doing is stabbing your pets for money. Animal cruelty plain and simple.\" with an image someone doing acupuncture on a dog. This statement makes the assertion that acupuncture lacks scientific validation but at best, works through the placebo effect in humans. Since animals can't experience this effect, the meme strongly suggests that veterinary acupuncture serves no medical purpose but is just harm inflicted on animals for some sort of financial gain.\n\nThe image of a person performing acupuncture on a dog reinforces this argument as it directly shows the cruel nature of the practice being criticized. Acupuncture is a controversial treatment in both human and veterinary cases, with many studies failing to find any evidence of its usefulness beyond placebo responses. This meme makes the strong argument b making the claim that applying such techniques on animals makes no sense and is cruel.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that veterinary acupuncture is a harmful practice as animals needlessly suffer (as they cannot benefit from the placebo effects), making it nothing more than a painful way for practitioners to profit. The tone is accusatory, framing veterinary acupuncture as a form of animal abuse."

The text says \"The only thing 'essential' oils are essential for is the seller's income. Aromatherapy has no proven medical benefits.\" alongside an image of an essential oil next to a candle. The quotation marks around \"essential\" gives an air of skepticism, making the suggestion that the term is misleading and exaggerated. By emphasizing the fact that aromatherapy has \"no proven medical benefits\" this meme dismisses the practice as a fake science rather than legitimate healthcare.\n\nThe image reinforces the association with aromatherapy, a practice which uses plant-derived oils to generate an aroma for supposed therapeutic and medical benefits. While some claim that these oils can alleviate stress, or treat medical conditions, scientific studies have overall failed to provide any evidence supporting these claims (other than the placebo effect). This meme reflects this skepticism by making the implication that the only real benefit of these oils is a financial gain for the people who sell them (rather than any actual health improvement for consumers).\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that aromatherapy is a useless practice with no scientifically proven benefits, and that its main use is to generate profit rather than health.

The text in the meme states: \"Claims big pharma won't sell natural medicines because they can't make a profit off what they can't patent. Spends $120 a month on water.\" on top of an image of a man drinking bottled water. The first sentence is a common belief among people distrustful of the pharmaceutical industry, saying that these companies suppress natural medicines because it cannot be patented, where the second sentence suggests a contradiction, as these same people spent a lot of money on bottled water (natural product sold at a premium cost).\n\nThe image of the man drinking from a water bottle reinforces this by depicting someone \"spending 120$ a month on water\". Just like pharmaceutical companies benefit from medicine, bottled water companies also profit from water which is naturally occurring. This meme suggests that, despite skepticism towards \"big pharma\" (a term referencing the pharmaceutical industry as a whole), many critics also participate in similar buying habits when buying expensive bottled water when it can be found free/less expensive. This undermines the argument that pharmaceutical companies are the only ones exploiting for the sake of profit.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that supporters who reject pharmaceutical companies due to profit motives are inconsistent, as they pay pay (willingly) high prices for other natural resources such as water. This meme has an ironic tone, mocking this supposed hypocrisy."

That's fantastic news!\", and it is a discussion between two men riding a bicycle carriage in the snow (with the image of the latter provided).\n\nThis meme is referencing the fact that climate change skeptics often pick individual weather events while ignoring the larger scientific data. Global warming refers to the overall increase in Earth's temperature over time, leading to long-term effects such as rising sea levels and melting polar ice (even with occasional cold weather). The first line represents a viewpoint held by climate change deniers who equate short-term weather patterns with long term global climate trends, with the second line sarcastically refuting the first statement by making the suggestion that if climate change didn't exist, the effects (rising sea levels and disappearance of polar ice) would be reversed.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that using short-term cold weather to dismiss global warming as a whole is flawed. This meme uses sarcasm to highlight the logical fallacy of misrepresenting temporary cold temperatures as indicative of long-term global temperature trends."

The text says \"Turkey does in fact contain L-tryptophan which can induce drowsiness. But no more than beef, chicken, or other common meats. So the drowsiness is more likely because you ate pig, had some wine, and then ate some more.\" with a painting of a 1700's European man yawning underneath it. This statement makes the clarification that although turkey contains tryptophan, it is not higher than other meats, debunking the idea that eating turkey alone is the main cause of sleepiness after a large meal.\n\nThe image of the yawning man further reinforces the feeling of drowsiness (aligning it with post meal fatigue). The meme makes the suggestion that the real reason for feeling sleepy after a large meal isn't turkey, but a large intake of food, such as pork and alcohol. This meme probably refers to the scientific research supporting the fact that eating meals rich in carbs and fats cause the body to redirect blood flow to digestion leading to drowsiness. Furthermore, alcohol consumption during the meal further contributes to this.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is to disprove the fact about turkey uniquely causing sleep and highlight that the post-meal drowsiness is because of over-consumption. This meme has a sarcastic tone, making fun of overindulgence of eating pork, wine, and more food as the real reason people feel sleepy after eating."

The text states \"Try to think of all the 'natural' things that can harm or kill you. Then ask yourself why the word sways your choice of food.\" followed by an image of a flower. This highlights the common idea where people associate the word \"natural\" with healthiness, even though many natural substances like venomous animals and poisonous plants can be dangerous/deadly.\n\nThis meme criticizes the tendency of some consumers to not go for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or processed foods just because they are not labelled natural. Historically, many people distrust GMOs because of their fears of unknown consequences, even though there is scientific research showing that they are safe overall. Meanwhile, other \"natural\" foods such as certain mushrooms, plants, and seeds can be highly toxic, bringing the \"natural\" label into question.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is to encourage deep thinking when making food choices rather than fall for marketing terms such as \"natural\". It makes the suggestion that just because something is labeled as natural doesn't mean it's actually better or safer.

The text states \"Could those of you saying that someone losing a Twitter account is akin to life under the Nazis kindly STFU?\" with a black and white image of a woman and child held at gunpoint during the Holocaust. By using strong language, the meme dismisses the comparisons of oppression and suffering faced by Jewish people under Nazi rule with losing a social media account.\n\nThe Holocaust was a period of genocide and extreme persecution where millions of Jewish people were systematically murdered. This meme makes a contrast between this horrific reality with the trivial issue of losing access to Twitter. Some individuals on the internet, especially those who are against online content moderation, have compared social media suspensions to censorship under totalitarian regimes (such as the Nazi regime during WW2) but the meme makes the suggestion that this comparison is not appropriate and diminishes the severity of historical events.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is to call out those who make extreme historical comparisons, arguing that losing a Twitter account is nowhere near the level of oppression experienced under the Nazis. This meme uses a blunt tone, as the use of \"STFU\" emphasizes that these comparisons should not be spread or taken seriously."

This meme seems to reference the 2020 political controversy where Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited a beauty salon in San Francisco despite COVID-19 restrictions, prompting criticism. By contrasting Water's supposed \"statement\" with Pelosi's situation, the meme makes a joke about the two politicians' actions as well as Waters' appearance.\n\nIn September 2020, Pelosi faced backlash after security footage showed her receiving a hair treatment indoors at a salon, even though local COVID-19 regulations prohibited such services. Conservatives accused her of hypocrisy for not following the same restrictions she supported. This meme frames Waters (another Democrat) as someone who did not take advantage of the same \"privileges\" as well as making a joke about her physical appearance, as she is known for wearing styled wigs.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that certain politicians have acted hypocritically during the pandemic, and the meme uses humor at Waters' expense to reinforce that argument.

The text is a conversation between a woman and a man (with their pictures provided), with the woman saying \"Diphtheria, polio, smallpox..\" and the man saying \"That is the problem with you pro-vaccine people. You keep bringing up diseases that almost nobody hears about anymore.\" The irony in this verbal exchange is that these diseases are not commonly heard of because vaccines have been effective in controlling/getting rid of them.\n\nThis meme addresses a misconception among people skeptical of vaccines who argue that vaccines are not necessary since diseases like smallpox/polio are no longer widespread. The reality is that vaccines placed a large role in eliminating these diseases, preventing their spread and countless deaths. For example, smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980 due to a global vaccination effort. This meme makes the suggestion that dismissing these diseases as irrelevant looks over the actual reason that they are no longer a threat, which is widespread immunization. By framing this argument as a conversation, the meme brings up the flawed reasoning behind vaccine skepticism.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that vaccines are important, and their effectiveness in eradicating diseases should be a reason to support them. The tone of the meme is sarcastic, using irony to emphasize the strangeness of dismissing vaccines due to their own success."

No. I just wanted to live in a time when vaccines being a good thing and the Earth being a globe wasn't something people actually debated.\" This meme uses the time-travel concept from the movie to suggest that in the past, the benefits of vaccines and the shape of the Earth were not up for debate. The humor in the meme is that Doc wants to return to a time when proven knowledge wasn't questioned.\n\nThis meme references the resurgence of scientifically debunked beliefs, such as the flat Earth theory and the claim that vaccines are inherently harmful. These views have been widely disproven by scientists but they still continue to exist, especially from the internet. The humor in the meme is making the suggestion that these beliefs have become so common place that Doc desires to go back to a time when these debates were proven facts. The mention of vaccines being a \"good thing\" and the Earth being a globe are common consensus that these ideas should not be questioned.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that science-based facts should be universally accepted and not debated.

Glyphosate is a commonly used herbicide and has been debated over its potential to cause cancer although the scientific evidence is disputed. This is contrasted to wine, which has established carcinogenic risks but is consumed widely.\n\nThis meme is built on the inconsistency between rejecting one potential carcinogen while consuming another. It makes the implication that those who oppose glyphosate because it is carcinogenic are being hypocritical if they ignore the same risks associated with drinking wine. By contrasting these examples, the meme questions the validity of their concerns about glyphosate, implying that it is a selective worry.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that criticism of glyphosate being potentially carcinogenic is undermined because the same critics supposedly continue to consume wine, which has proven carcinogenic effects.

His image supports the message by reminding viewers of them about his long career in debunking pseudoscience.\n\nThis meme brings up a common issue in today's world where many people follow ideas or groups blindly without doing their own research. By using Randi's quote, it points out that if someone already believes something without reason, no amount of evidence or logical argument is likely to change that person's mind. This idea is based on Randi's work which always encouraged people to think critically and question certain claims rather than accept them at face value.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that blind belief leaves no room for reason, and those who do not examine their beliefs critically will remain unmoved by facts/logic. The tone is straightforward, urging viewers to rely on critical thinking and research rather than simply following ideas."

It\u2019s impossible to reconcile the idea of landing on the Moon with the idea of a flat Earth, as a spherical Earth would be evident from space; this is even evident from the photograph shown itself, as the continents can be seen warped as things are when wrapped around a sphere. The claim that the Moon landing \"discovered\" the Earth\u2019s flatness is a parody of how conspiracy theorists twist facts to fit their beliefs.

The image suggests that these were the gathering of the people involved in the supposed cover up. This meme uses the image and sarcastic text to suggest that it would be impossible for a conspiracy theory to involve so many people staying silent for decades.\n\nThis meme is built on the long-standing conspiracy theory that the 1969 moon landing was a government fabricated hoax with thousands of people staging the event.

This is the punchline; Jake is not actually 'woke' because his approach to knowledge is selective. While rejects authority, he falls prey to unreliable content online that doesn't cite sources, undermining his own credibility.\n\nThe meme conveys that skepticism of authority does not make someone 'woke', and that describing oneself as such means they are of questionable credibility themselves."

The text says \"Claim: Acupuncture is a form of Chinese medicine that is thousands of years old. However: The technology for making the needles is only a few hundred years old.\" with an image of a female masseuse massaging another woman's back. This contradiction calls into the question the authenticity of acupuncture as it is presented.\n\nThis meme is built on the narrative that acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China. However it introduces the counterpoint about the manufacturing of metallic needles needed for the procedure. The image seems to represent that some aspects of acupuncture may have been modernized or misrepresented over time.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that the claim of acupuncture being ancient is undermined by the recent technology behind its core tool, being the needle. The tone is skeptical, urging viewers to question the accuracy of popular narratives about its origins."

    "annotation": "This meme juxtaposes the image of a doctor with a brain injury and the notion of a successful naturopath to align the two, communicating that naturopathy is uncredible.\n\nThe meme is of a man that is holding a stethoscope on his own head, sporting a wild-eyed facial expression. Stethoscopes are used to listen to heartbeats, often used by doctors on patients' chests; the visual of a stethoscope on a head, that to the doctor's own head, communicates that the doctor doesn't know what he's doing. The wide eyed expression he is sporting supports this idea.\n\nThe top text reads, 'Had a brain injury and forgot everything he learned in medical school.' This builds on top of the assumption that the doctor isn't of his right mind developed in the imagery. It is a common trope in media that people forget things after a head injury. The phrase is also somewhat exaggerated, as someone with a brain injury may not forget everything, but the humor is in the extreme idea of a total loss of medical knowledge, as medical school is known to take years and be extremely hard.\n\nThe bottom text reads, 'Successful Naturopath.' Naturopathic medicine is a system that uses natural remedies to help the body heal itself. Naturopathic medicine is disputed by science. This is the punchline; that a medical doctor that has forgotten everything and has no remaining skill has found a career as a naturopath, a career that is questionable.\n\nThe meme uses its intellectual backing and visual humor to make a case that naturopathy and naturopaths should not be taken seriously and are not qualified medical professionals in any way."

The tone of the meme is set to be one of exasperation and annoyance, suggesting that what is being said is ludicrous in some manner.\n\nThe text reads, 'When someone ignores your peer reviewed citations and tells you to \"do ur research\" '. This implies things about this 'someone' - that they haven't read the paper that contains the citations, or haven't bothered to read the citations themselves.\n\nScientific research is peer reviewed to ensure that the findings are reputable and correct. People who tell others to \"do ur research\" tend to have limited knowledge on the topic and no related credentials; because if they did, they would be able to parse the provided citations.\n\nThe meme critiques how some people, despite being presented with credible evidence, remain adamant in their own beliefs and dismiss anything that contradicts their opinions, revealing that they do not believe in objective truths."

The text says \"How to tell if your dog is involved in a sex scandal\" with an image of a frowning dog alongside pictures of frowning politicians including Anthony Weiner, Bill Clinton, Eric Massa, and Tim Mahoney. This is designed to mock the notion of a political scandal by comparing it to something as mundane as a dog's expression.\n\nThis meme is built on the facts that these politicians have been in sexual misconduct controversies, making the implication that their frowning expressions is a symbol of \"proof\" for their involvement. By tying these images with a dog exhibiting a similar frown, the meme suggests that the sign of being in a sex scandal is just having a frown. The comparison this meme makes ridicules both the political scandals themselves and how they are sensationalized.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that the commonplace frown associated with political sex scandals is so generic that even a dog could be mistaken for being involved. The tone is mocking, using the surreal comparison of a frown to poke fun of these scandals."

This implies the content that follows is explosive in nature.\n\nThe text reads, 'Just when you think Democrat ethics, honesty, integrity and behavior have hit rock bottom, they blast through the rock bed\u2026 to a never-before-seen depth.' The meme argues that despite already lacking severely in those virtues, Democratic politicians continue to find a way to be even less virtuous. The image could be interpreted as a visual representation of the phrase \u201cbreaking new ground,\u201d which, along with the last part of the text, makes the argument that the level of perceived depravity reached by the Democratic party at the point of the meme\u2019s creation had never been reached. There are no specifics given as to what actions, beliefs, or policies show this deprecation in values, so it can be assumed that the party\u2019s platform as a whole is being derided.\n \n            The meme paints the Democratic party as a perpetually disappointing and wrongdoing party, and also argues that they go to great lengths to further this descent."

He is pointing a finger at her. The woman is holding a book. Both her glasses and the book subtly imply she is from an academic background. The man's angry expression and pointed finger paint him as an aggressor. Through this, the viewer gets an impression that he is going to say something outlandish that she will provide a logical explanation to.\n\nThe top text, from his perspective, reads ''If chemtrails aren't real, explain why they appear to turn on and off all the time?'' The chemtrail conspiracy theory is a erroneous belief that condensation trails left in the sky by aircraft are actually sprayed for harmful purposes. The man presents his statement demandingly as a 'gotcha', implying that she will not be able to provide a logical response to the 'on/off' phenomena.\n\nThe bottom text, from her perspective, reads \"The same reason why you see your breath on a cold day, but not a hot day, dummy.\" This is the punchline that calmly explains the reality of the situation, cold facts in contrast with his over the top conspiracy. It contrasts the irrational, overly emotional argument with the calm, straightforward explanation, which serves as a reminder that many conspiracy theories can be debunked with basic, logical thinking.\n\nThis meme juxtaposes rational explanations and irrational beliefs to communicate how conspiracy theorists overthink simple concepts."

The text says \"Aside from vitamin seller, This is the main beneficiary when you megadose vitamins,\" and is paired with an image of a toilet. This implies that instead of providing health benefits, taking too many vitamins results in large amounts of physical waste.\n\nThis meme is built on the idea that some people believe that taking large doses of vitamins can replace proper medicine, diet, or a healthy lifestyle. It challenges this idea by humorously suggesting that regardless the amount of vitamins being consumed, the excess vitamins just get flushed out. The image of the toilet emphasizes that the only \"winner\" in a megadose scenario is not an individual, but their bathroom.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that taking large doses (\"megadosing\") on vitamins is ineffective because it is a waste of money and does nothing other than fill your toilet. The tone is playful, using humor and the image of a toilet to mock the idea that more vitamins automatically means better health."

The text says \"So why are we marching against Monsanto and not all the other companies who make the same products?\" and the other replies, \"Uh\u2026 just chant the slogans and don't ask questions!\" with an image of a large crowd protesting on the street.\n\nThis meme is built on the controversy surrounding Monsanto, a company criticized for its pesticide usage and impact on public health. By bringing up a protest against Monsanto, the meme questions why activists focus solely on this one company when there are many others in the industry using similar practices. The text in the meme is presented as a dialogue between 2 people, and the dismissive response from the second person suggest that some protest movements are more about following slogans than spending time analyzing the problem. The meme implies that the decision to protest is driven by an idea rather than a deep understanding of the issues.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that blind protesting and chanting without deep inquiry leads to simplified activism which misses the larger idea. The tone of this meme is sarcastic, using humor to point out that protestors are focused on one company when they should be focused on others as well."

Her relaxed position emphasizes a lack of action, which contrasts with the ambitious and dramatic claims made in the text discussed in the next paragraph. This visual setup creates an ironic tension, where she is portraying herself as someone ready to take on big, world-changing tasks, yet she is disengaged from doing anything to accomplish them.\n\nThe top text reads, 'I'm going to strike a blow at Monsanto, expose the Rothschils, and warn everyone about big pharma!' Monsanto was a chemical company that was guilty for exposing people to pesticides that can cause serious health problems. The Rothschilds are a banking family that have been accused of secretly controlling the economy. Big pharma is the name given by conspiracy theorists to drug manufacturers that are accused of unethical practices for monetary gain. The boldness of her claim of violence toward wildly influential entities suggests a great dramatic action, which is laughably juxtaposed by her relaxed position on the couch.\n\nThe bottom text reads, 'As long as I don't have to get off the sofa.' This is the punchline, highlighting all the revelations outlined earlier; it undercuts the grandiose ambitions of the top text by revealing the woman\u2019s lack of motivation to take any real action.\n\nThe meme exposes the gap between grand ambitions people talk about online and the reality of the lack of actual action they will take."

The photo is quite distressing, evoking a very emotional response from the viewer. Upon seeing the image, one feels a strong urge to prevent whatever caused this harm to the infant. It communicates a heavy gravity to the topic of the meme.\n\nThe top text reads, 'While well-fed westerners campaign against crops genetically modified to be higher yielding, and drought resistant'. The phrase 'well-fed westerners' sits in stark juxtaposition from the malnourished infant gasping for air. The text points to the fact that some people in wealthy nations oppose genetically modified crops, which are designed to produce a higher yield and be drought resistant. It criticizes the privilege of these individuals, suggesting that their campaigns against GMOs are disconnected from the very real consequences that others (such as this baby) face.\n\nThe bottom text reads, 'Those with no voice continue to die in drought induced famines.' This is the punchline that directly ties the image of the baby to the message. It points out that the people who are most affected by famine, especially those in regions facing drought, are often those with the least ability to influence global food policies. It implies that the people in the west concerned about GMOs must consider speaking on behalf of the baby, as the baby cannot.\n\nThe message of the meme is that the concerns of those who oppose GMOs in well-fed countries are trivial in comparison to the life-and-death struggles faced by people in famine-stricken parts of the world."

The peaceful, serene setting contrasts with the serious issue being discussed in the text, which creates a subtle irony.\n\nThe top text, from the father's perspective, reads \"I can't believe how much positive feedback I'm getting from other anti-vaccine activists on Facebook.\" This reveals that social media approval is something that the father finds value in, discrediting his integrity as he values social approval. His comment suggests that he is part of an echo chamber of dangerous beliefs, communicating the danger of misinformation spreading online.\n\nThe bottom text, from his child's perspective reads, \"I'm glad you're getting some attention Dad, but why am I the one who has to get sick?\" This response from his child is the punchline, shifting the tone from the father\u2019s pride to the tragic reality of his sick child that he was able to prevent. The humor is dark, relying on the sad irony of the father\u2019s enthusiasm for his dangerous beliefs while his child is the one who is paying the price for his actions.\n\nThe meme communicates through dark humor that the pursuit of social validation through anti-vaccine activism can have severe, real-world consequences to children's health."

By separating this statement from the rest of the text, it punctuates its weight; 5,000 calories is quite a lot of food. For context, the recommended daily intake for adults is 2,000 calories per day.\n\nThe bottom text reads, 'Thinks the restaurant is the problem.' This is the punchline and is what drives the humor of the meme. It reveals that despite the man\u2019s extreme calorie intake, he is placing blame on restaurants. The humor lies in the absurdity of the situation: the man is stuffing himself with 5000 calories a day, yet he\u2019s redirecting the blame. The restaurant simply just provided the food. The overall text is highlighting a personal responsibility with eating habits over the responsibility of restaurants.\n\nThis meme utilizes exaggeration to call out the disconnect between personal choices and the tendency to deflect blame."

The tone is slightly incredulous, as if the speaker is looking for a possible explanation.\n\nThe bottom text reads, 'Exactly how does breaking blood vessels and causing clots and bruising \"enhance circulation\"?' This is the punchline and the main issue of cupping therapy that is posed. It is plainly questioning how the visible damage caused by cupping, such as broken blood vessles, can possibly improve circulation, which is the benefit that cupping proponents claim.\n\nThe meme communicates that the practice of cupping is illogical through poignant pauses and plain language."

The visible money in the flames is also $100 bills. This image is striking; money, which is valuable and meant to be used for practical purposes, is being destroyed for no benefit. The woman\u2019s action of fanning the flames with more money adds an extra layer of absurdity, by painting her as frivolous for continuing to waste resources in a futile way.\n\nThe top text reads, 'For those times when you just can't make it to your reiki session,' Reiki therapy is a way of guiding energy throughout the body to promote the recipient's self-healing abilities. Some people believe that Reiki therapy is a pseudoscience. Reiki therapy sessions tend to be expensive. This line is neutral, but sets up for the punchline along with the imagery.\n\nThe bottom text reads 'but you wanted the same results.' This is the punchline of the meme. This line sarcastically reveals that going to reiki is essentially the same as burning up money. It is of note that there is no medical backing to the practice of Reiki.\n\nThe meme uses sarcasm to mock pseudosciences such as Reiki by saying it is as pointless as burning the money itself, because the results are intangible and not backed by measurable evidence."

The text says \"Researchers have developed a type of rice to combat vitamin A deficiencies in poor countries that cause widespread blindness and over 600,000 childhood deaths annually. The well fed people at Greenpeace oppose this. What kind of people are they?\" with an image of a blind girl. The text implies that Greenpeace's objection is from a privileged perspective.\n\nThe meme is built on the controversy surrounding Golden Rice, a genetically modified crop created to address nutritional deficiencies in poor regions. While Golden Rice has been hailed for its potential to prevent blindness and save lives, Greenpeace (a network of organizations with the goal of exposing environmental issues) has criticized its commercial success due to concerns over genetically modified organisms and other environmental risks. The text on the meme sarcastically labels the opposition coming from \"well fed people\" making the suggestion that those in Greenpeace do not have any personal experiences with the consequences of vitamin A deficiency. Furthermore, the image of the blind girl further reinforces the consequences of Vitamin A deficiency, and how Greenpeace's opposition is insensitive to the real suffering experienced.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that the criticism from groups like Greenpeace against Golden Rice is elitist and disconnected from real world suffering cause by vitamin A deficiencies. The tone of the meme is critical, using irony to challenge the beliefs of the anti-GMO stance by mentioning the life-saving benefits of Golden Rice."

As soon as you science nerds stop making the same tired old dihydrogen monoxide jokes over and over again,\" with DiCaprio then staring intently at Murphy. This dialogue represents two sides, one frustrated by debunked anti-vaccine claims and those tired of making the same predictable scientific puns about water.\n\nThis meme references the disproven claim that vaccines cause autism, which still surfaces among some group. On the other hand, it acknowledges frequent jokes about dihydrogen monoxide, a large term for water used to make fun of people who fear things that are harmless. The meme combines both of these in a conversation format to highlight how both sides are stuck in the same repetitive rhetoric, as the anti-vaccine proponents cling to old claims and science enthusiasts using the same jokes over and over again.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that both sides of the \"debate\" produce unproductive rhetoric rather than having any needed meaningful discussions or evidence-based discourse.

This meme draws attention to the backlash Biden received for his \"you ain't black\" remark, with Thomas' response acting as a reminder of Biden's lack of authority/importance.\n\nThis meme is built on the controversy surrounding Biden's remark as it was criticized as inappropriate and dismissive an entire community's identity. By pairing this with Clarence Thomas' comment (being a Black American himself), this meme suggests that Biden's statement brought down his own credibility, with Thomas diminishing Biden's standing by saying \"You ain't President!\". This meme uses irony to imply that if Biden is willing to make inappropriate statements about race, he might lack the legitimacy expected from an actual president.\n\nThe overall message of the meme is that controversial remarks harm one's credibility as well as can be countered by a supposed lack of authority or power.

The wordplay with \u201cage\u201d and \u201cwage\u201d positions an attack on Joe Biden, referencing public discord about him being a child predator. This insinuation weaponizes existing controversies against Joe Biden, blending humor with an attack on his character.\n\nAdditionally, the contrasting body language of Joe Biden and Barack Obama contribute to the meme\u2019s message. On the left side, Joe Biden is seated in a relaxed posture, his hands clasped in front of him, exuding a calm and nonchalant demeanor. This expression suggests that he is either unaware of the mistake implied in his statement or entirely unbothered by it. The nonchalant expression amplifies the comedic effect by suggesting that Biden is oblivious to the gravity of his supposed error. On the right side, Barack Obama\u2019s body language and expression provide a stark contrast.

These elements reference Snoop Dogg, a rapper widely associated with marijuana culture. The caption at the bottom reads, \u201cSNIFF DOG,\u201d a play on words combining Snoop Dogg\u2019s name with allegations against Biden for inappropriately smelling people\u2019s hair or invading their personal space. These allegations have been fueled by widely circulated photos of Biden engaging in such behavior, particularly around women and children. By merging these two ideas, the meme delivers its critique in a humorous and memorable way, amplifying its attack on Biden\u2019s character.\n\nBiden\u2019s facial expression in the image further contributes to the meme\u2019s message. The altered photo shows him with a subtle smirk, which can be interpreted as conveying confidence or self-satisfaction. This expression is exaggerated to suggest that Biden is not only aware of the actions he is accused of but might even take pride or enjoyment in them. The smirk adds an additional layer of mockery, implying arrogance or a lack of remorse. The combination of this facial expression with the other visual elements heightens the satirical tone of the meme.\n\nOverall, the meme mocks Joe Biden, for being perceived as \"creepy,\" a narrative fueled by widely circulated photos of him appearing to smell or invade the personal space of others, particularly women and children."

The use of the word \u201cboss\u201d reinforces this dynamic, suggesting that Biden still views Obama as an authority figure or mentor, even though Biden is president.

That\u2019s Kamala now.\u201d This line serves multiple purposes. First, it humorously suggests that Biden continues to rely on Obama for guidance despite no longer being his vice president. Second, it shifts the focus to Kamala Harris, implying that she holds more influence or control over the administration than Biden himself. By framing Harris as the \"boss,\" the meme reinforces a narrative often used by critics that Biden lacks the mental sharpness or decisiveness required for his role and is instead being guided or overshadowed by others within his administration.\n\nOverall, the meme critiques Joe Biden\u2019s mental fitness and leadership capabilities.
