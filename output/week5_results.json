DiCaprio's expressions may add to the comedic delivery, suggesting skepticism or amusement at the irony.\nAmazon Web Services, GoDaddy, and Google are massive corporations that dominate their respective industries, and using their services often means contributing to their power and influence. This undermines the blog's anti-corporate message, as it actively depends on the infrastructure and tools provided by these companies to function.\nOverall, this meme shows the juxtaposition of the anti-corporation conspiracy blog when the blog itself is using big corporation technologies. The meme underscores the difficulty of escaping corporate influence in a modern, interconnected world.",

The background is that Joe Biden actually was the Democratic party's presidential nominee in 2020, but the meme is suggesting discontent or disillusionment regarding his candidacy.\nOverall, the meme is comically expressing the disappointment or anger that some Democrats would have had with Biden's candidacy in that it's implying that his nomination didn't come with fanfare or even that he was considered the best candidate of the party.",

Sure, but aren't you ignoring the struggles of hard working individuals in the soybean mines?\" The use of this analogy highlights the irony of the argument. The initial half of the statement postulates that not eating plant-based meats is being undertaken to support farmers, normally those who deal in livestock for meat purposes. The second half of the meme then wryly notes that plant-based meat substitutes also support farmers, specifically those who produce soybeans, which are used to produce plant-based proteins. By using the \"soybean mines\" (an imaginary, hyperbolic notion), the meme is referencing the notion that those farmers are also laboring to create something which ultimately finds its way into the alternative meat market, thereby pointing to the possible unexpected byproduct of only supporting the meat industry.\nThe picture is of a man and woman talking and having a drink at a restaurant, an informal setting for this conversation about food choice. This setting gives the conversation the sense of everyday people sitting around talking about it, duplicating the way everyday people converse about eating habits and the ethical issues of whether to buy from one farm sector versus the other.\nIn general, the meme humorously satirizes the multi-step decisions of what types of agriculture to participate in, mocking the notion that one type of agriculture is simply more ethical than another but really implying that those who avoid plant-based meat in order to support farmers are ignoring the farmers who produce crops such as soybeans.",

The image is used to highlight the irony of fearing radiation from 5G but utilizing common household appliances without fear.\nGenerally speaking, the meme satirically mocks the unwarranted hysteria surrounding 5G technology by using an example of a common household appliance to show how people are apt to ignore actual risks and focus instead on unfounded conspiracy theories.",

    "annotation": "This meme makes a challenge to the age old belief that acupuncture and the meridian system were ancient Chinese concepts, by making their attribution to French author George Soulie de Morant in 1939. The text says: \"Where did the 'ancient' concept of Qi and meridians that your acupuncture practitioner speaks of originate? From this French author in 1939. Nothing ancient or Chinese about it.\" This statement is placed alongside an image of George Souli\u00e9 de Morant, emphasizing the claim that he was the true originator of these concepts rather than them being rooted in Chinese history.\n\nThis meme is built on the skepticism towards acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine by challenging the legitimacy of its origins. The claim of Soulie de Morant (rather than Chinese practitioners) formulating the concepts of Qi and meridians in 1939 implies that acupuncture is not as \"ancient\" or \"Chinese\" as often marketed. This is aligned with broader criticisms of alternative medicine where tools such as acupuncture are questioned for their validity. Furthermore, the watermark at the bottom of the photo \"Facebook.com/skepticalmemesociety\" implies that this meme was made by people in an online forum focused on skepticism of commonly accepted historical facts. This meme suggests that many people accept acupuncture's origins without actually examining its history, making it seem like a case of cultural rebranding.\n\nThe overall message of this meme is that acupuncture and concept of Qi are not truly ancient Chinese, but a modern idea. The tone is critical, seeking to undermine the credibility of acupuncture by portraying it as artificially constructed belief system.",

The top panel shows a flooded suburban neighborhood, accompanied by the text \"If you criticize others for ignoring hard scientific data confirming anthropogenic global warming...\" This refers to the scientific consensus that human activity is a significant driver of climate change, which some people deny. Those that do not believe in climate change are heavily criticized for not accepting overwhelming evidence of its existence.\n\nThe bottom panel contrasts this with an image of corn, with the text, \"..but ignore hard scientific scientific data that shows GMO foods are safe and organic food has no nutritional advantage...\" This highlights another areas of scientific discord: genetically modified organisms (GMOs). One side of this discord argues that GMOs are safe for consumption and do not drastically differ in nutritional value from organic foods. The opposing side reject these claims.\n\nThe final caption at the bottom of the meme reads, \"You're doing science wrong!\". This statement critiques the hypocrisy of criticizing those who do not believe in climate change, but turn a blind eye to the genetic modification of foods.
