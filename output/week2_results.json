This behavior refers to a conspiracy that Hillary Clinton secretly murders political opponents, or people who could compromise her corruption.\n\nNadler's relevance to the conspiracy on Clinton refers to the 2016 presidential election, when Clinton's controversial emails were leaked. Nadler made fun of former president Donald Trump for overreacting to the scandal, so people suspected that Nadler had some connection/insider knowledge about the emails.

      "OpenRouter": "The underlying message of this meme is a criticism of governmental priorities and hypocrisy surrounding the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. It points out the inconsistency in the government's response by highlighting the contrast between their leniency towards individuals burning buildings during protests and their strict enforcement of mask-wearing mandates. The meme's moral message is that the government's actions and choices in enforcing regulations appear arbitrary, misguided, and morally questionable. It underscores the importance of fairness, consistency, and ethical decision-making in governance."

    "annotation": "The meme is mocking people who are anti-Trump, presumably political leftists.\n\nIt features a picture of a news anchor, with a blue wallpaper behind him, patterned with the words, \"Channel 4 News.\" This depicts the meme as a news report. Leaning into this portrayal, the captions provide the anchor's headline, which begins, \"Breaking: the same people who said Trump would destroy America...\", before trailing off. The term \"breaking\" is used here as typical vocabulary of news reports that express urgency and novelty of the news topic.\n\nThis urgency surrounding the \"people who said Trump would destroy America,\" or people who are anti-Trump, is then delivered in the second caption: they \"are destroying America.\" This corresponds to the picture within the main image, which the news anchor is presumably reporting on. It features people cheering in front of a fire. Presumably, this depicts a left-leaning 2020 Black Lives Matter protest, which has escalated into violence and destruction. Since anti-Trump people are generally left-leaning, these people are meant to equate leftists and opposition to Trump.\n\nThe meme expresses a hypocrisy in that these people who claimed \"Trump would destroy America\" are now themselves burning, or rather, \"destroying America.\" The repetition of the phrase \"destroy America,\" separated by the trailing pause which is followed by a punchline, creates a sardonic humor that overlays an expressed disappointment in anti-Trump leftist behavior.\n\nThus, the meme's message is an attack on anti-Trump leftists, accusing them of hypocrisy and condemning their violent protests.",

    "annotation": "The meme is making fun of United States Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nBeginning with the caption at the top, it reads, \"AOC after getting called a bitch:\". The image below then depicts AOC's response to receiving this insult.\n\nThe image is taken from Star Wars. It focuses on an ominously hooded Emperor Palpatine. He is pale, wrinkled, and generally ugly. According to the caption at the bottom, he says, \"The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed.\" The intent is to portray AOC using Palpatine, and so \"getting called a bitch\" has left AOC \"scarred and deformed.\" This is a major overreaction to a verbal rebuke, and as such, paints AOC as easily offended and of poor mental fortitude. The absurdity of the portrayed behavior creates a humorous tone, mocking AOC.\n\nFurther, comparing Palpatine to AOC ascribes some of the fictional emperor's traits to her. He is the evil primary antagonist of the story, and as such, depicts AOC as some overly evil villain, again emphasizing the humorous nature of the meme through exaggeration. His ugly appearance also insults AOC's appearance as well.\n\nThus, this meme's message consists of two main points: (1) AOC is evil, and (2) she is easily offended.",

    "annotation": "The meme is mockingly accusing liberals of hypocrisy.\n\nIt is a two-panel comic, focused on a man conversing with an angry-looking woman at a protest.\n\nThe top panel shows the woman with a surgical mask edited to cover her mouth, referencing the mask regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, scientifically supported by the Center for Disease Control to reduce the spread of coronavirus. In accordance with this, the woman is presumably exclaiming the captions to the image: \"You need trust science asshole!\" This aggressive statement directed towards the man is because he is not wearing a mask, and therefore not trusting the scientific justification behind wearing masks.\n\nPresumably, the woman is a liberal, because of her support of wearing masks and participation in a protests, both of which traditionally comprise liberal behavior.\n\nThe lower panel shows the man's response to the woman. He replies with a question: \"Ok. How many genders are there?\" The man is highlighting that the gender spectrum supported by liberal ideology has no scientific basis, as biologically, there are only the two sexes, male and female. In other words, the angry woman, and liberals in general, do not \"trust science\" because they believe in the gender spectrum. The man's retort has also angered the woman further, with her mask coming off to reveal a furious mouth expression, and her eyes now red and smoking with fury. This exaggerated anger is meant to make fun of the woman, and the liberals in general that she represents, portraying them as quick to anger.\n\nFurthermore, the comic points out a hypocrisy in liberal logic. They vehemently support the science for wearing masks, but they ignore the science when supporting the gender spectrum. This, combining with the exaggerated portrayal of the woman, leads to the humorous overall message: liberals are easily-offended hypocrites.",

The meme aims to satirically highlight this perceived hypocrisy among liberals, portraying them as easily-offended individuals who are quick to assert the importance of science only when it aligns with their preconceived beliefs."

    "annotation": "The meme is criticizing gun regulation for endangering women.\n\nThe meme features a picture of a woman aiming a handgun. Her face expresses a seriousness and defensiveness that evokes sincerity in the meme. The caption provides commentary on this image. It first reads, in green, \"An intruder wouldn't try to disarm this woman,\" followed in black by, \"your elected representatives promised to do it for him.\"\n\nThe coloring of the words separates them into two separate thoughts, where the second section in black explains the strange claim of the first. It is unusual that an intruder would not try to disarm a woman; presumably, they would want to in order to avoid being shot. The second section explains this by claiming that the \"elected representatives\" of the government would do it for him. In other words, the government has promised to disarm the woman; in particular the meme is alluding to gun control.\n\nThe implication is that the government's implementation of gun control would disarm this woman, thereby making intrusion easier, since trespassers would not need to be afraid of a gun threatening them. Gun control is generally supported because people believe that removing deadly weapons would reduce violence and crime, though the meme argues that it would cause the opposite, increasing crime.\n\nThe sense of direct urgency in endangering the depicted woman's life transfers to the meme's final message and condemnation: gun control endangers people.",
